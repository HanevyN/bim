# Bim!

Bim! is an open-source online multiplayer mobile game inspired by
classics such as Bomberman (also known as Dyna Blaster).

Up to four players are stuck in a small arena with a single goal: be
the last person standing. The players can drop bombs to destroy the
walls or, ultimately, attack another player. Sometimes the broken
walls will expose a bonus such as extra bombs or an increase of the
bombs' blast distance.
