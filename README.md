Up to four players are stuck in a small arena with a single goal: be
the last person standing. The players can drop bombs to destroy the
walls or, ultimately, attack another player. Sometimes the broken
walls will expose a bonus such as extra bombs or an increase of the
bombs' blast distance.

The match features can be selected from the matchmaking
screen. Features enabled by all participants will be used in the game,
allowing players to customize their contest.
